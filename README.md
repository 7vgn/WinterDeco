# Winter Decoration

Every year since 2023, I have created a winter-themed pice of decoration based on a custom-made PCB. The primary goal was to get some SMD soldering practice, but they also make nice presents. 

* [Evergreen Tree](2023/) (2023)
* [Simon the Snowman](2024/) (2024)
* [Old-fashioned Computer](2025/) (2025)
* [Spider Web](2026/) (2026)

All projects run on a CR2032 coin cell and feature the [PIC18F14Q41](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/pic18f14q41) microcontroller. The firmware was developed in [MPLAB X](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) using the [XC8](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers/xc8) compiler. You need a PIC programmer such as PICkit, SNAP, or a suitable third-party clone to flash the firmware. 

The PCBs were designed with [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/). Ready-to-manufacture Gerber files for JLCPCB are included.
